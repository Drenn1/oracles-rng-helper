This program determines where in the RNG sequence you are in Zelda: Oracle of
Ages or Seasons, to assist with RNG manipulation. Currently only used for the
Ages D6 boss key room.

# Usage

In the Ages D6 BK room, after pulling the lever once and killing the ropes,
start slashing your sword and input the sounds it makes here. The sword can make
Low (L), Mid (M), and High (H) sounds (based on its pitch). When the program has
enough data, it will tell you how many more times to slash the sword in order to
fix the RNG to give you the boss key.

# Controls

L/M/H: Input sword slash sounds. 1/2/3 also work.

Backspace: Delete an input.

R: Reset input.

Escape: Exit.
